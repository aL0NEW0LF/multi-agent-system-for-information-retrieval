Abstract
Lithium metal, due to its advantages of high theoretical capacity, low density and low electrochemical reaction potential, is used as a negative electrode material for batteries and brings great potential for the next generation of energy storage systems. However, the production of lithium metal dendrites makes the battery life low and poor safety, so lithium dendrites have been the biggest problem of lithium metal batteries. This study shows that the larger specific surface area and more pore structure of Cu-based metal-organic-framework - aramid cellulose (CuMOF-ANFs) composite separator can help to inhibit the formation of lithium dendrites. After 110 cycles at 1 mA/cm2, the discharge capacity retention rate of the Li-Cu battery using the CuMOF-ANFs separator is about 96 %. Li-Li batteries can continue to maintain low hysteresis for 2000 h at the same current density. The results show that CuMOF-ANFs composite membrane can inhibit the generation of lithium dendrites and improve the cycle stability and cycle life of the battery. The three-dimensional (3D) porous mesh structure of CuMOF-ANFs separator provides a new perspective for the practical application of lithium metal battery.
